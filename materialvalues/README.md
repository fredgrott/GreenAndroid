MaterialValues
==============

This is a soft-forking of Matthieu Esnault's MaterialValues project. I extend it 
as the Android Support Libraries cover nothing of the nitty gritty details of 
Material Design as far as dimens, etc.

# Credits

Credit goes to Matthieu Esnault who in his MaterialValues project:


[Materialvalues](https://github.com/AoDevBlue/MaterialValues)

analyzed the Material Design document and organized those dimens in that 
doc as android resources.
